Greetings, 

Dear professor, classmates and friends let me briefly indroduce myself.  
My name is Makhabat.

I am from a small and beautiful country Kyrgyzstan which is conveniently located in Central Asia. 

I grew up in a multicultural and multilingual society which has fostered my interest in different cultures, languages, and countries. 

I love traveling, I love exproling the new places and cultures, so far I have been to 10 countries and counting. 

Besides traveling I also enjoy reading, cooking, eating, outing, and just having a good time with my family and friends. 

All my previous schooling was in the fields of education, teaching and translation, therefore I feel excited for this new journey into the world of Business Administration and Technology Management. 

In the course of this program I hope to have a quality time discovering/exploring all the new and exciting things it has to offer.

Wooow, my brief introduction turned out to be not so brief, anyway thank you for your time and I am looking forward to our next project. 


Cheers!
